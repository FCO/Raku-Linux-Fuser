# Linux::Fuser

Discover which process has a file open, in pure Perl 6.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/p6-Linux-Fuser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/p6-Linux-Fuser)

## Description

This is based on the similarly named module for Perl 5 available from CPAN.

Linux::Fuser provides a mechanism to determine which processes have a specified
file open in a similar manner to the system utility *fuser*. There is an example
program *p6fuser* in the *examples* directory which provides a Perl 6 implementation
of that command.

Because this relies on the layout of the /proc filesystem specific to the Linux
kernel it almost certainly will not work on any other operating system, though I
would be delighted to hear about any where it does work.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to install this
with *panda* :

   panda install Linux::Fuser

Or if you have a local clone of the repository

	panda install .

While I have only tested with panda I can't see any particular reason why this
shouldn't work with *zef* or some equally capable package manager.

## Support

Suggestions/patches are welcomed via github at:

https://github.com/jonathanstowe/p6-Linux-Fuser/issues

I'm not able to test on a wide variety of platforms so any help there would be 
appreciated.

## Licence
